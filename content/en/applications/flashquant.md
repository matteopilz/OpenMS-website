### Input/Output
- Input: Centroided MS1 scans (*.mzML)
- Output: Quantified proteoforms in a tab-separated file (*.tsv); optionally, OpenMS LC-MS features output (\*.featureXML)
  - for each proteoform, mono-isotopic/average mass, retention time range, charge range, different types for quantity values, and isotope cosine similarity score are provided.
- Parameters can be found by running FLASHQuant using the "--helphelp" option.

### Consensus FeatureGroup (putative proteoform) detection
FLASHQuant executes per LC-MS run; thus, we provide an additional simple tool for detecting consensus feature groups (i.e., jointly detected proteoforms) among multiple scans (i.e., technical replicates) named **ConsensusFeatureGroupDetector**. Retention time and mass tolerance can be adjusted with parameters.

### GUI
FLASHQuant and (consecutive) ConsensusFeatureGroupDetector can be executed easily with the GUI, **FLASHQuantWizard**.
