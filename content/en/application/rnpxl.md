RNP<sup>xl</sup> has been integrated into OpenMS and also the Proteome Discoverer Community Nodes. No custom installer is required anymore.

### Requirements:

- HCD data acquired on a high-resolution MS
- Developed and tested on orbitrap instruments
- MS and MS/MS need to be centroided (either on acquisition, conversion or in a workflow using the TOPP tool HiResPeakPicker)

For additional information on sample handling and acquisition, as well as a detailed step-by-step tutorial, please refer to the supplementary material of the publication.

### Raw files:

The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium (http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org) via the PRIDE partner repository with the dataset identifier [PXD000513](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD000513).

### FAQ:

- Q: RNPxlcrashes with error message indicating that an idXML was not found:

```
Error: File not found (the file 'C:/Users/username/AppData/Local/Temp/MSfilename_Number_Number_variant.idXML' could not be found)
RNPxl failed!
```

- A: OMSSA has problems reading the path to the database. Check that the path to your database or windows temp directory doesn’t contain any spaces or additional dots. Make sure that all database related files (.fasta, .phr, .pin, .psq) are in the same folder and have the same name that you defined both in the parameters of the RNPxl tool and the OMSSA .ini file. Also make sure there is no dot except for the one between file name and file type, e.g., do not call the database “uniprot.human.fasta”

- Q: Can you provide some details on the mass and losses of 4-thio-U nucleotide?

- A: The monoisotopic mass of a 4-thio-U nucleotide is: 340.01301 (C9H13N2O8PS).However, a net loss of H2S has always been observed in our cross-linking experiments, making the adduct mass: 306.02529 (C9H11N2O8P). This adduct is observed on precursor level. Fragmentation cleaves off phosphate and ribose, leaving 94.01671 (C4H2N2O) as adduct on MS2 level.
