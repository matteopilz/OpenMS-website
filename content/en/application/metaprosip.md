## MetaProSIP: automated inference of elemental fluxes in microbial communities

{{< notice info >}}
MetaProSIP has been fully integrated into OpenMS. No additional installer is required anymore.
{{< /notice >}}

**Update: MetaProSIP now supports labeling experiments with heavy water (D, 18O)**

Download an updated KNIME workflow: [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/open-ms/files/Papers/MetaProSIP/)

Advanced workflow including mass recalibration, alignment, and ID pooling: [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/open-ms/files/Papers/MetaProSIP/)

### Requirements

- High-Resolution MS, CID, or HCD MS<sup>2</sup>
- Developed and tested on orbitrap instruments
- MS<sup>1</sup> and MS<sup>2</sup> need to be centroided (either on acquisition, conversion or in a workflow using the TOPP tool HiResPeakPicker)

For additional information on sample handling and acquisition please refer to the original MetaProSIP publication.

### FAQ:

- Q: I get an “Error: Process returned with a non-zero status.“ “Error: File not found (the file ‘C:/Users/USER/AppData/Local/Temp/cluster_result_15NMix_1_3_a_picked_yD9N.dat’ could not be found)“.
- A: Make sure that a suitable R version (32 bit) and the R packages are installed and add the directory to your PATH environment variable.
- Q: What do the columns in the group output refer to
- A: See [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i8JoLFenmsUlkh4dYSsu1AUGXKGczPPSX7E7rXKYLhA/edit?usp=sharing%20for%20a%20detailed%20explanation) annotated example sheet

### Raw files:
The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium (http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org) via the PRIDE partner repository with the dataset identifier [PXD000382](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD000382).
