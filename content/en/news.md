### New OpenMS read.the.docs manual

_1 Sep 2022_ The OpenMS team is proud to present a new OpenMS manual at openms.readthedocs.io. This manual provides much more detail about mass spectrometry including links to relevant sections of University of Tübingen video lectures and a glossary. It also provides more detail about installing OpenMS and it includes the pdf tutorial that was used in classroom presentations of OpenMS. Creation of the manual was supported by grants from Google Season of Docs, from the University of Tübingen and from the Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative Diversity&Inclusion program.

### Second OpenMS documentation update

_14 Apr 2022_ The OpenMS team has won a 2022 Google Season of Docs grant to update the OpenMS documentation. Combined with money from the University of Tübingen and from the Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative, a team of three technical writers will review and rewrite OpenMS documentation. The 2022 team consists of Rahul Agrawal, Christina Kumar and Tapasweni Pathak.

### Summary of the OpenMS developer meeting 2022

The OpenMS developer meeting 2022 near Corinth, Greece was a highly successful gathering of OpenMS developers and those interested in becoming one. The meeting was filled with insightful presentations, productive breakout sessions, and engaging social events.

One of the highlights of the meeting was a presentation by Timo Sachsenberg, who provided an update on the current state of OpenMS and gave attendees a sneak peek into upcoming developments. Julianus Pfeuffer's presentation on OpenMS workflows in the workflow managers KNIME and nextflow was also highly informative. He also discussed the CI/CD architecture and build system of OpenMS, providing valuable insights into the project's development process.

The rest of the week was dedicated to a variety of breakout sessions that provided developers with the opportunity to participate in little developer tutorials, documentation tasks, smaller development tasks, and discussions about the future of OpenMS. These sessions were highly productive and allowed developers to exchange ideas, discuss potential issues, and develop new features for the platform.

In addition to the work-related activities, attendees were also treated to several social events, including a trip to the ancient amphitheater in Epidaurus, a visit to the ancient city of Mykene, and a dinner in Nafplio. These events allowed attendees to network and build relationships with their peers in a relaxed and enjoyable environment.

Overall, the OpenMS developer meeting 2022 near Corinth, Greece was a highly successful event that provided attendees with valuable insights into the current state of OpenMS and the direction in which it is headed. The breakout sessions and social events were equally productive and enjoyable, making the meeting a valuable experience for all who attended.
